# This Flask app requires a Python backend server
# Netlify is not suitable for this type of application
# Use Heroku, Render, or Railway instead

# For reference, this app needs:
# - Python runtime environment
# - Flask server
# - SQLite database support
# - Session management

# Recommended deployment:
# 1. Use Heroku with the existing Procfile
# 2. Or use Render.com for free Python hosting
# 3. Or use Railway.app for modern deployment
